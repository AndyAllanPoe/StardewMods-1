I had a 6/13 score (2 candles) and he said he was really dissapointed and wasn't sure if it was a good idea to leave the farm to me.
I got 7/13 and he said I did a decent job w/ the place! Pfft I worked my ass off yo!
For calculating the candles, less than 4 points is 1 candle, 4-7 is 2, 8-11 is 3, 12 or more is 4.

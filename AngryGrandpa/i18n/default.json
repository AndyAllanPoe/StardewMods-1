    // Please be careful not to remove symbols, dialogue keys, or special character sequences (like \" or _ or #$b# or $y) when translating.
    // For example, @ is a placeholder for player name, %farm is a placeholder for farm name, and %rival gives a random same-gender name.

    // Do not remove or change any symbols {0}-\n\n , \n\n , @-^^ , ^^ , or [#]
    // Text that comes after [#] is the mail preview name; this is shown when you hover over a letter in collections.

// TRANSLATION TEXT FOR DISPLAY MESSAGES
// =====================================

    // These text entries are brand-new messages that appear when you collect a bonus reward from Grandpa's Shrine.
    // In vanilla, finding the statue of perfection shows: "You found a peculiar statue behind Grandpa's Shrine."

    "Object.cs.1CandleReward": "You found a very old seed on top the shrine.",

// TRANSLATION TEXT FOR EVENT SCRIPTS
// ==================================

  // =======================
  // TOKENS AND INSTRUCTIONS
    
    // Token used in EvaluationEvent {{countYears}} when grandpa says long you've had the farm. E.g. "You've been here [four years now]..."
    // The first in list, "less than a year now", is used when Config.YearsBeforeEvaluation = 0
    "GrandpaCountYears": "less than a year now|one year now|two years now|three years now|four years now|five years now|six years now|seven years now|eight years now|nine years now",
    // Used instead when Config.YearsBeforeEvaluation = 10 or more
    "GrandpaCountManyYears": "many years now",
    // Used instead when Config.YearsBeforeEvaluation = 10 or more AND Config.GrandpaDialogue = "Nuclear"
    "GrandpaCountManyYears.Nuclear": "a really fucking long time",

    // Keys ending with -gn are gender-neutral. These should stay as close as possible to the standard scripts, but anything
    // like "boy", "girl", "grand-daughter" that refers to the player should be replaced with a gender-neutral phrase.
    
    // TODO: Invalidate the cache at the start of each new year? Recalculate the values for "GrandpaCountYears" based on the lesser of YBE and actual Y? Also need to invalidate the cache on Spring 2 year 1 to wipe out the "Fifth Candle" additions. NOPE - just need to invalidate the StringsFromCSFiles cache *inside* the code of the grandpaEvaluation... I think that will do it.
